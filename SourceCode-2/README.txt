Installation
For better performance and a more convenient user experience, we strongly recommend that you install PyCharm, which is an integrated development environment to compile and run python code. You can refer to the link https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installation-guide.html#c5f524df for specific tutorials on installing PyCharm. 

After you successfully installed PyCharm, you can refer to the link https://www.python.org/downloads/ for specific tutorials on installing Python. You can choose the latest Python version, which is 3.10.11 for right now.

After that, you can open the python code using PyCharm, whose name is Warehouse_Navigation_Application_V5.py. For the first three lines of code, right click on the red underlined code and choose to import the missing packages.

You are all set! Begin running the program to solve your problem!

Running the Program from PyCharm
Right-click the code, and then click the run button, the PyCharm will automatically compile and guide you to the start page of our project.

Running the Program from Terminal
You could also access our project through terminal. You could follow these processes:
(1)	Make sure to copy your warehouse text files and our code file(Warehouse_Navigation_Application_V5.py) to the same folder.
(2)	Use the command cd “your folder that hold the Warehouse_Navigation_Application_V5.py”to change to the folder you store the source code and text file. Please replace the part enclosed in quotation marks with the real file path in your computer.
(3)	Use the command python3 Warehouse_Navigation_Application_V5.py to start and run the program.

Tasks Completed
(1)	Support command line to visualize the warehouse.
(2)	Support product search by ID and coordinates.
(3)	Support dynamic workers start position and product setting.
(4)	Support selection of 3 different algorithms—brunch and bound, held-karp, and nearest neighbor algorithm. We support brunch and bound algorithm for multiple access points
(5)	Support computation of time and memory for different algorithms.
(6)     Support manually setting up the timeout limit. 

Potential Errors
(1)	malformed text file: User should provide the text file in the same format as https://canvas.eee.uci.edu/courses/54695/assignments/1156345
(2)	Input position of product and worker should be valid. They should not exceed the boundary of the warehouse.
