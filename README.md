# Warehouse-Navigation-Application
The Warehouse Navigation Application aims to streamline the process of picking goods from shelves in a warehouse by employing efficient pathfinding algorithms. This application targets both human workers and robots, ensuring that orders are fulfilled swiftly and accurately while minimizing travel time.

## Features
- Multiple access points enable

## Project Outcomes

The final deliverable of this project is a working implementation of the Canny Edge Decoder, with simulation and verification results that demonstrate its performance and accuracy. The implementation includes a pipeline architecture that allows for efficient processing of large images, and a memory management system that minimizes memory usage and maximizes throughput.
